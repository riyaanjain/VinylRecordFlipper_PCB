# 🎵 Automatic Vinyl Record Flipper

I love vinyl records.

But as a 21st century kid, I may be too lazy for the repeated getting up and down required to continue playback of music every few minutes or so. I love my record collection, but I just wish that, after I put the record on, it would just play the entire album.

So, we took matters into our own hands and built an **automatic vinyl record flipper**.

Included are:
- 🛠️ **PCB Design Files**
- 💻 **The program code**
- 📷 **A picture and video for your enjoyment**

Hopefully, you enjoy it as much as I did.

Thank you for stopping by!

## 🧠 What It Does

This device automatically flips a vinyl record by sending PWM signals to servo motors using an ESP32 microcontroller once it finishes playing a side. It detects the tonearm rest position using a Hall effect sensor, then lifts, rotates, and drops the record back down.
